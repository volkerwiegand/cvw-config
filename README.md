# cvw-config
Shell based remote configuration system for CentOS 7

### Important notice and disclaimer

This configuration system is neither documented nor unit tested.
Any documentation is the source code itself.
There is no guarantee whatsoever that it is usable for anyone.

That said, it works quite well for me.

## Quick installation guide

1. Keep the entire directory tree in one place
2. Setup the master binary (called "cvw") in your PATH (can be done with bin/cvw_setup.sh)
3. Create a directory for each server to be supervised (see under www.example.com)
4. Call any program without paramaters to see its options
5. If you like what you see - use it (maybe even help with documentation or tests)
6. Enjoy.
